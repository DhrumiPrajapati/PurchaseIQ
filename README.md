# PurchaseIQ: Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
**PurchaseIQ** is an end-to-end data analytics project focused on analyzing customer shopping behavior in a retail environment. The project uses transactional and demographic data to identify patterns related to customer engagement, purchasing behavior, and revenue distribution, and presents insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow using **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI**, from raw data preparation to business-ready insights.

## 🎯 Business Objective
The objective of this project is to support a retail business in:
- Understanding customer purchasing patterns
- Identifying trends across demographics and product categories
- Analyzing customer engagement behaviors such as subscriptions and shipping preferences
- Enabling data-driven decision-making through clear visualizations

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

- **Domain:** Retail customer shopping behavior  
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Customer demographics (age group, gender)
  - Product categories
  - Subscription status
  - Shipping types
  - Review ratings
  - Purchase amounts

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Number of customers
- Average purchase amount
- Average review rating
- Revenue and sales breakdowns by category and age group
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration

## 🔑 Key Insights
The analysis shows that customer purchasing behavior differs meaningfully across engagement-related attributes such as product category, subscription status, and repeat activity. Rather than being evenly distributed, customer value is concentrated within specific behavioral patterns, making engagement metrics an important lens for retail analysis.

Category-level trends highlight differences in both sales volume and revenue contribution, reinforcing the importance of monitoring product performance beyond total sales counts. The interactive dashboard allows these patterns to be explored dynamically, enabling stakeholders to validate observations and compare segments as needed.

## Conclusion
PurchaseIQ demonstrates a practical, end-to-end retail analytics workflow using Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI. The project focuses on transforming transactional data into clear, explorable insights that support business understanding.

The final dashboard is designed for non-technical stakeholders, allowing key trends and customer segments to be examined interactively. Overall, the project reflects the type of analytical and reporting work commonly expected in a professional data analyst role.
